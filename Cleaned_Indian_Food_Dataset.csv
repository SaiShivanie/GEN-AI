Whole Wheat Pita Bread Recipe,"1-1/2 cups All Purpose Flour (Maida),1-1/4 cups Lukewarm Water,1-1/2 cups Whole Wheat Flour,2 tablespoons Extra Virgin Olive Oil,2 teaspoons Active dry yeast,1-1/2 teaspoons Sugar,1/2 teaspoons Salt",70,Continental,"To begin making the Pita bread we will first have to get your ingredients ready especially the yeast.
If you are using active dry yeast (look like small round balls) - follow the instructions given in the packet.If you are using fast action yeast (looks more like fine semolina) then in a large bowl combine the flours, salt and sugar and gradually add in the yeast and knead the dough until smooth and elastic, adding little flour if it tends to get sticky.
Once all of the ingredients form a ball; add the olive oil and place the ball on a work surface and knead the dough for approximately 10 minutes.
Repeated kneading combines all the ingredients well and will help the bread rise well in the oven.Once you have finished kneading and gained enough arm muscle; place the dough in a large bowl coated with olive oil and cover it with cling wrap/plastic wrap and allow it to rise for about 2 hours.After two hours you will notice that the dough has doubled.
At this point punch the dough down and knead gently.
Divide the dough into 10 portions and roll each portion into a ball.
Place the balls on a baking sheet and cover them with a damp cloth and let them sit for another 30 minutes.While the dough is resting, preheat the oven to 250 C.
The oven should be preheated for at least half an hour before you can bake the pitas in them.
Now it should be time to work your dough into flat bread.
Take one ball, dust it with a little flour and dust the work surface as well.
Using a rolling pin, roll the pita into an oval or a circle.
Make sure the pitas are thin; about 1/8th inch or 1/4 inch thick.
Continue the same with the remaining dough balls.Place the rolled portion of pita bread on dusted baking sheets and place it inside the oven.
Bake the pita dough until they puff - you will see them rising forming bubbles, to slowly puffing and fully puffing up.The whole process takes a maximum or 3-5 minutes and not more than 5 minutes.
If the pita bread does not rise in 5 minutes, then take them out.
The Pita Bread will still be cooked, but just wont have pockets and will still taste just as good.You can serve Whole Wheat Pita Bread Recipe along with soups or make it into sandwiches like Egg Bhurji Stuffed Pita Pockets Recipe, Aloo Tikki Stuffed Pita Sandwich Recipe, Pita Sandwich With Cauliflower Falafel And Roasted Vegetables Recipe and more.",https://www.archanaskitchen.com/whole-wheat-pita-bread-recipe,"salt,wheat flour,water,dry yeast,virgin olive oil,sugar,flour (maida)",https://www.archanaskitchen.com/images/archanaskitchen/World_Breads/Whole_Wheat_Pita_Bread_Recipe-2.jpg,7

Toss the mix together till all the flavors are well combined.For the spicy beans, place a pan on heat, add some oil to it and allow it to get warm.Add the onion, garlic and sauté it for 1-2 minutes until the onions are softened.
Then add tomato puree and cook for 5-10 minutes on a medium heat.When the mix begins to bubble, add the cooked kidney beans/rajma along with the water that was used for cooking it.
Stir well.Add Chipotle chilli along with Adobo sauce, crushed cumin and salt.
If using red chilli flakes instead, add it now.Mix it all up well and cook to make a thick sauce.
This may take 5-7 minutes.
Turn off the heat and keep it aside.For the sautéed peppers/vegetables, place a pan on heat, add some oil to it and allow it to get warm.Once done add all the chopped peppers (or any other vegetables that you may like) along with the garlic.Sprinkle salt and sauté for 1-2 minutes.
Then, add chilli flakes and oregano, toss together and turn off the heat.
Keep aside till ready to use.For the roasted corn salsa, char the corn on the stove top or in a preheated oven.
Take the kernels off the cob and put it in a bowl.Add in the rest of the ingredients and mix thoroughly.
Keep aside until later use.For the guacamole, prepare the Avocado guacamole but remember that guacamole needs to be eaten fresh, so this is one component that has to be made last, or just before assembling and serving the burrito bowl.To assemble the burrito bowl, if you are preparing one big bowl for your guests, use a fairly deep 8-9” flat bottom bowl or serving dish.A burrito bowl is essentially layered, so begin with the coriander-lime rice.
Spread it generously at the base of the bowl.Over it, spoon the spicy beans and spread it around the rice.Next, layer the sauteed peppers over the beans.On top of that goes a layer of guacamole.Spread some corn salsa over it, and top it with the lettuce (if using), cheese and black olives and serve.If you are making individual burrito bowls for a smaller crowd, follow the same sequence of layers, but use smaller sized ramekins for serving.To make a Burrito Bar, simply place all the prepared components on convenient location.
Give your guests individual bowls and allow them to choose their favorite toppings to assemble the bowls of their choice.To serve it as a warm winter casserole, once assembled, bake the bowl in a preheated oven at 180 degrees Celsius for 15 minutes and serve hot with baked Tortilla chips.Serve the Mexican Vegetarian Burrito Bowl for a wholesome dinner followed by a dessert of Apple Enchiladas.

Sprinkle some salt and sauté the bhindi and the onions on low heat.
Keep the pan covered for the few minutes so the bhindi gets cooked.When covered the bhindi releases moisture, but this moisture helps it to cook and soften as well.Once you notice that it has released a little moisture and the bhindi is slightly softened, open the pan and stir fry the bhindi until it is well roasted.
Make sure you roast it on medium heat.
Roast the Bhindi until you notice it has begun to shrink and has browned.
It should not become sticky, slimy and gooey.
If it has turned this way, add a little more oil and sprinkle some gram flour/besan and stir it gently.
This will absorb the sliminess.The bhindi is a tricky vegetable to cook, so it takes some practice to not making it gooey.Once the bhindi is cooked and well roasted, keep it aside till we prepare the yogurt gravy.To make the Yogurt Curry, add the yogurt into a saucepan; add the gram flour, grated ginger, garam masala powder,  turmeric powder and chili powder.
Whisk until smooth.
Add in 1/4 cup of water and whisk again until well combined.Place the saucepan on a medium heat and allow the yogurt mixture to come to a brisk boil.
Allow it to boil for a couple of minutes and then turn the heat to low.
Simmer the mixture until the yogurt becomes thick and creamy.
Once thick and creamy, add in the roasted bhindi and stir.
Simmer for a few more minutes.
Check the salt and spice levels and adjust to suit your taste.Turn off the heat and transfer the Dahi Bhindi a serving bowl.

Gradually add water into the flour mixture and knead to make a soft and smooth dough.Once all the flour has come together, keep kneading for 3 to 4 minutes so the dough becomes smooth and soft.
Cover the dough and keep it aside for 10 minutes till we prepare the filling for the kachori.The next step is to make the filling for the Corn and Matar Kachori.Into a food processor, add all the filling ingredients and pulse to make a coarse mixture.

You can either shape them as flat breads or keep it as a ball, its a personal choice.And to cook the Kachori's you can either use an Air Fryer, Bake in an Oven or Deep Fry them.

When you bring the dough you might find some excess dough collected on the top, remove this dough.Proceed to make the remaining Matar Kachoris the similar way.You can either choose to keep the Kachori like a ball or roll the Kachori gently to make a 3 inch diameter circle.
Take care when you roll, as the filling might spill out.If you are using the Air Fryer or the Oven, then preheat them at 180 C for about 15 minutes.
Place the Kachoris in the Air Fryer Basket or the Baking sheet (for the oven) and bake until the Kachoris are golden brown and crisp on all sides.If you plan to deep fry them, then preheat the oil for deep frying.
Once the oil is heated, fry the Kachoris on low to medium heat until you get a deep golden brown color and it is crisp.
Once golden, drain on absorbent paper and proceed to make the remaining Kachoris the similar way.Serve these mouth watering Corn and Matar Kachoris as a tea time or evening snack along with Green Chutney and Date Chutney.

Its easy to work when you have the ingredients in arms reach when you are making a recipe.I like roasting vegetables in wok as opposed to an oven, as wok roasted retains more moisture, make the vegetable feel a little more succulent and also gets done faster too.To begin, heat the two tablespoons of olive oil in a wok; add in the garlic, the red peppers, the quartered potatoes.
Sprinkle some salt, and stir fry until the salt gets well combined into the vegetables.
Cover the pan, turn the heat to low and simmer until the potatoes get roasted and cooked through completely.
